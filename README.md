This is my first attempt doing a better website. I know it's not that good, not even fair but the basics are enough for now. I'll keep updating this website in the future, whenever I have new ideas I can add on. I have a full time job and am doing my best to do a little bit of coding everyday. 

Any recommendations would be much appreciated.
